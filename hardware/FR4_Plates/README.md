# FR4 Plates for Arisutea
アリステア FR4 PCB Plates design formatted ready for JLCPCB. Plate files are updated to reflect changes to the full backspace on switch 59. The plates are designed to fit with the full backspace and non-stepped capslock. That being said, these will not work on the original Fate Designs PCB.

## Disclaimer: Use these files at your own risk. 

#### Assembly Materials
These are just what I used, obviously you can sub whatever you want. But this worked best for my assembly.
