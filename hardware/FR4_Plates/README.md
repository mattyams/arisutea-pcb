# FR4 Plates for Arisutea
アリステア FR4 PCB Plates design formatted ready for JLCPCB. Plate files are updated to reflect changes to the full backspace on switch 59.  These are en route as I type this (3/7/2021) from JLCPCB and will update on their fitment and parts needed once they have arrived. For the fitment, I will be using the PCB design by CorruptedJef and robotictomato to test the plate fitment and go from there.
