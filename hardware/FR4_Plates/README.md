# FR4 Plates for Arisutea
アリステア FR4 PCB Plates design formatted ready for JLCPCB. Plate files are updated to reflect changes to the full backspace on switch 59.  The plate have been ordered and fab'd and should arrive this coming week (3/9/2021).  I will post hardware used and updates once I get it all put together. I will be using the design by CorruptedJef and robotictomato to test the plate fitment and go from there.
